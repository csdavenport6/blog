# Building with Next.js and WASM

Today I want to share my experience integrating WebAssembly (WASM) with Next.js. This combination opens up exciting possibilities for high-performance web applications.

## Why WebAssembly?

WebAssembly allows you to run code written in languages like Rust, C++, or Go directly in the browser at near-native speeds. This is perfect for:

- **Computational tasks** - Image processing, data analysis
- **Game engines** - Physics simulations, rendering
- **Legacy code** - Porting existing C/C++ libraries

## Setting Up WASM in Next.js

Here's a simple Rust function compiled to WASM:

```rust
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn fibonacci(n: u32) -> u32 {
    match n {
        0 => 0,
        1 => 1,
        _ => fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2),
    }
}
```

The integration with Next.js is surprisingly smooth, and you can check out the `/wasm` page on this site to see it in action!

## Next Steps

I'm planning to explore more complex WASM use cases, including:
- Image manipulation tools
- Real-time data processing
- Interactive visualizations

Stay tuned for more updates!
